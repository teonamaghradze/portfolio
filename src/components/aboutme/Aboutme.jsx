        <h2>ðŸš€ My journey into the Web Development </h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve always been interested in computer sciences but for some reasons
          I had never imagined that I could enroll in this field until recently.
          Web developer career caught my eye as its centered on creative problem
          solving thatâ€™s pretty appealing to me. Since then, I've been soaking
          up knowledge in web development, building a solid foundation both in
          theory and practice.
        </p>
        <h2> ðŸ’¡ What Sparks My Coding Passion</h2>
        <p>
          Every day, I'm improving and learning new skills and spending most of
          my time coding. I'm a hardworking person who can handle multiple
          tasks. I even learned and worked on projects using two
          frameworksâ€”React and Angularâ€”that were completely new to me. The
          coding process excites me, especially the perfect mix of creativity
          and logic.
          {/* I enjoy the challenge of transforming a design idea into a
          user-friendly interface.  */}
          Crafting layouts and making things functional is what I love the most.
